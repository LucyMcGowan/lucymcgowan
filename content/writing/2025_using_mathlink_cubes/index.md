This article explores an innovative approach to teaching data wrangling skills to students through hands-on activities before transitioning to coding. Data wrangling, a critical aspect of data analysis, involves cleaning, transforming, and restructuring data. We introduce the use of a physical tool, mathlink cubes, to facilitate a tangible understanding of datasets. This approach helps students grasp the concepts of data wrangling before implementing them in coding languages such as R. We detail a classroom activity that includes hands-on tasks paralleling common data wrangling processes such as filtering, selecting, and mutating, followed by their coding equivalents using Râ€™s dplyr package.
