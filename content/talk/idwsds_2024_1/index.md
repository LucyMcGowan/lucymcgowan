excerpt: "Invited sessions at conferences provide important opportunities for the exchange ofideas. But how do we get invited? And how can we do the inviting? In this panel, wewill bring together experienced women in statistics from all career stages to sharetheir tips on organizing invited sessions. Our panelists have planned and participatedin numerous successful invited sessions at statistical conferences and have served onprogram committees to plan and select these sessions on a large scale. This panel isintended to demystify the invited session proposal process and to empowerresearchers to submit their ideas in the future."
