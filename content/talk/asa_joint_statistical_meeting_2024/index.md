excerpt: "A challenge that all data analysts face is building a data analysis that is useful for a given audience. In this talk, we will begin by proposing a set of principles for describing data analyses. We will then introduce a concept that we call the alignment of a data analysis between the data analyst and audience. We define a successfully aligned data analysis as the matching of principles between the analyst and the audience for whom the analysis is developed. We will propose a statistical model and general framework for evaluating the alignment of a data analysis. This framework can be used as a guide for practicing data scientists and students in data science courses for how to build better data analyses."
