excerpt: "In studies where randomization is not possible, imbalance in baseline covariates (confounding by indication) is a fundamental concern. Propensity score matching (PSM) is a popular method to minimize this potential bias, matching individuals who received treatment to those who did not, to reduce the imbalance in pre-treatment covariate distributions. PSM methods continue to advance, as computing resources expand. Optimal matching, which selects the set of matches that minimizes the average difference in propensity scores between mates, has been shown to outperform less computationally intensive methods. However, many find the implementation daunting. SAS/IML® software allows the integration of optimal matching routines that execute in R, e.g. the R optmatch package. This presentation walks through performing optimal PSM in SAS® through implementing R functions, assessing whether covariate trimming is necessary prior to PSM. It covers the propensity score analysis in SAS, the matching procedure, and the post-matching assessment of covariate balance using SAS/STAT® 13.2 and SAS/IML procedures."
