abstract = "\"If you’re navigating a dense information jungle, coming across a beautiful graphic or a lovely data visualization, it’s a relief. It’s like coming across a clearing in the jungle.\" – David McCandless. <br><br>  The ability to create polished, factual, and easily-understood data visualizations is a crucial skill for the modern statistican. Visualizations aid with all steps of the data analysis pipeline, from exploratory data analysis to effectively communicating results to a broad audience. This tutorial will first cover best practices in data visualization. We will then dive into a hands on experience building intuitive and elegant graphics using R with the ggplot2 package, a system for creating visualizations based on The Grammar of Graphics."
