excerpt: "This talk addresses challenges with making health record data and clinical trial data compatible. The data collected in trials is collected regularly and in an organized way, while data from health records is messier and more haphazard. A clinical trial has a clear start and endpoint, while health record data is collected continuously. Additionally, clinical trial participants may be healthier than patients we see in health records. Covariates are defined in advance for a trial, but must be predicted or imputed from the health record. In this talk I will discuss some of the challenges we have encountered in trying to integrate trial data with observational health records to improve power and design new trials."
