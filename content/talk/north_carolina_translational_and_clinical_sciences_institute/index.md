excerpt: "The debate over the value and interpretation of p-value has endured since the time of its inception nearly 100 years ago.  The use and interpretation of p-values vary by a host of factors, especially by discipline.

These differences have proven to be a barrier when developing and implementing boundary-crossing clinical and translational science.  The purpose of this panel discussion is to discuss misconceptions, debates, and alternatives to the p-value."
