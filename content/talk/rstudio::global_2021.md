abstract = "This talk will walk through building a self-contained randomized study using Shiny and learnr modules. We will discuss building informed consent, the randomization process, demographic surveys, and R-based studies into a single online framework to allow users to seamlessly enroll and participate in randomized studies via a single URL. The talk will include both practical recommendations as well as technical code snippets."
