abstract = "This talk will cover two R packages: matahari (https://github.com/jhudsl/matahari) and tidycode (https://lucymcgowan.github.io/tidycode/). The matahari package is a simple package for tidy logging of everything you type into the R console. The tidycode package allows users to analyze R expressions in a tidy way (i.e. take the code captured from matahari and put it in a tidy table for downstream analysis with the tidyverse)."
