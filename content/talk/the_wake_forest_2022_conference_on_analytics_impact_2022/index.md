excerpt: "The Wake Forest Conference on Analytics Impact is focused on the impactful use of analytics to solve problems in business, non-profits, government agencies and society. During the pandemic, government officials and healthcare professionals have more so than ever before, had to communicate to the public using healthcare data. How to communicate these data statistically and visually to influence people’s behavior has proven very challenging. What have we learned about communicating with data during this crisis? What did we get right and what failed? This year’s Conference on Analytics Impact is focused on communicating with health care data and lessons learned from the pandemic."
