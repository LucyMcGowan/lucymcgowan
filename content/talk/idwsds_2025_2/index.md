excerpt: "This talk demonstrates data extraction from multiple sources using the popular television series Severance as an example. For example, we collected and analyzed elevator sounds predict narrative events, voice recordings underwent cepstral analysis to estimate fundamental frequencies and characterize speaker- specific distributions, with k-nearest neighbors used for classification, and text mining was performed on episode scripts to quantify dialogue patterns. These analyses illustrate how statistical methods can be applied to unconventional data sources from entertainment media."
