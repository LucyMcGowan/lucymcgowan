abstract = "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects data on health practices and risk behaviors via telephone survey. This study focuses on the question, On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? Recall bias is a potential concern in interviews and questionnaires, such as BRFSS.
