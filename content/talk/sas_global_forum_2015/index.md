excerpt: "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects data on health practices and risk behaviors via telephone survey. This study focuses on the question, On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? Recall bias is a potential concern in interviews and questionnaires, such as BRFSS. The 2013 BRFSS data is used to illustrate the proper methods for implementing PROC SURVEYREG and PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC, using the complex weighting scheme that BRFSS provides."
