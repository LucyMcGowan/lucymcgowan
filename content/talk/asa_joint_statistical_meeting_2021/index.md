excerpt: "We are interested in studying best practices for introducing students in statistics or data science to the programming language R. The “tidyverse” is a suite of R packages created to help with common statistics and data science tasks that follow a consistent philosophy. We have created two sets of online learning modules, one that introduces tidyverse concepts first and then dives into idiosyncrasies of R as a programming language, the second that takes a more traditional approach, first introducing R broadly and then following with an introduction to a particular suite of packages, the tidyverse. We have created a randomized study to examine whether the order certain concepts are introduced impacts whether learning objectives are met and/or how engaged students are with the material. This talk will focus on the mechanics of this study: how it was designed, how we enrolled participants, and how we evaluated outcomes."
