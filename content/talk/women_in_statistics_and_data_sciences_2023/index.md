excerpt: "Invited sessions at conferences provide important opportunities for the exchange of ideas. But how do we get invited? And how can we do the inviting? In this panel, we bring together experienced women in statistics from all career stages to share their tips on organizing invited sessions. Our panelists have planned and participated in numerous successful invited sessions at statistical conferences and have served on program committees to plan and select these sessions on a large scale. This session, sponsored by the Caucus for Women in Statistics, is intended to demystify the invited session proposal process and to empower researchers to submit their ideas in the future."
