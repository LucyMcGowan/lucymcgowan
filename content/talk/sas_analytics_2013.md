abstract = "In the current job market, it is common to be inundated with resumes and applications. It has become increasingly important to streamline the evaluation process in order to sift through these candidates. Anecdotally, we recently received 50 resumes for 2 positions, many of which did not meet the minimum qualifications for employment. In order to minimize the time spent evaluating these resumes, and maximize the objectivity and efficiency of the process, we developed a SAS macro to determine which candidates should progress to a first round interview."
