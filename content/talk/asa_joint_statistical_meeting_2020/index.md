excerpt: "In the age of \"big data\" there is an information overload. It is increasingly important for people to be able to sift through what is important and what is noise, what is evidence and what is an anecdote. Accordingly, the effective communication of statistical concepts to diverse audiences is currently an education and public health priority. This talk focuses on techniques to strike an appropriate balance, with specifics on how to communicate complex statistical concepts in an engaging manner without sacrificing truth and content, specifically addressing how to help the general public read past headlines to the actual evidence, or lack there of. We will discuss engaging with the public via organizations such as TED Ed - focusing both best practices and lessons learned."
