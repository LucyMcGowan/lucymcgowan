excerpt: "Data Science, as a broad and interdisciplinary field, is one of the fastest growing areas of student interest (and employment opportunities). The traditional introductory statistics courses that would typically serve as a gateway to data science need modernized curricula and pedagogy in order to adapt to today’s increasingly large and complex data sources and data science questions. In this session, we share our experience to address the following issues:

• What constitutes the fundamentals of good data science practice? • How to teach a data science course with innovative pedagogy? • How to improve communication skills to bridge data scientists and practitioners? • How to take advantage of virtual learning?

Discussant: Linda Zhao
Speakers: Leanna House on Adapting student engagement strategies for a virtual environment, Lucy D’Agostino McGowan on Bringing Data Science Communication into the Classroom, and Nusrat Jahan on Data Science Education in Undergraduate Setting. There will be three speakers and a discussant in this session."
