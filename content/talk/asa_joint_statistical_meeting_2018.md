abstract = "We often want to harness the power of the internet in our daily data practices, i.e., collect data from the internet, share data on the internet, let a dataset evolve on the internet and analyze it periodically, put products up on the internet, etc. While many of these goals can be achieved in a browser via mouse clicks, these practices aren't very reproducible and they don't scale, as they are difficult to capture and replicate. Most of what can be done in a browser can also be implemented with code. Web application programing interfaces (APIs) are one tool for facilitating this communication in a reproducible and scriptable way. In this talk we will discuss the general framework of common R clients for web APIs, as well as dive into specific examples. We will focus primarily on the googledrive package, a package that allows the user to control their Google Drive from the comfort of their R console, as well as other common R clients for web APIs, while discussing best practices for efficient and reproducible coding."
