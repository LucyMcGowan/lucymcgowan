excerpt: "R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. We are interested in presenting a panel of regional leaders in the R-Ladies movement. We will discuss topics such as diversity data in the R community, best practices for starting up a meetup in your own community, best practices for running and continued success of a meetup in your community, and funding opportunities. We will also diagnose different obstacles and discuss how we attack them, for example increasing womenâ€™s competence versus confidence versus recognition in the R community. Finally we will provide resources and details about how to get involved with local meetups."
