excerpt: "This 6 week series will cover causal inference model building and evaluation techniques. In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You’ll be able to use the tools you already know--the tidyverse, regression models, and more--to answer the questions that are important to your work."
