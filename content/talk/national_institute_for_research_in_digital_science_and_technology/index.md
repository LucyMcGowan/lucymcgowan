excerpt: "Missing data is a common challenge when analyzing epidemiological data, and imputation is often used to address this issue. There are recommendations to include the outcome from the analysis model in the imputation model for missing covariates, but it is not necessarily clear if this recommendation always holds and why this is sometimes true. This talk will discuss deterministic imputation (i.e., single imputation with fixed values) and stochastic imputation (i.e., single or multiple imputation with random values) methods and their implications for estimating the relationship between the imputed covariate and the outcome. We will mathematically demonstrate that including the outcome variable in imputation models is not just a recommendation but a requirement to achieve unbiased results when using stochastic imputation methods. We will then dispel common misconceptions about deterministic imputation models and demonstrate why the outcome should not be included in these models. This talk aims to bridge the gap between imputation in theory and in practice, providing mathematical derivations to explain common statistical recommendations."
