excerpt: "Clear statistical communication is both an educational and public health priority. This session will focus on best practices for effective statistical communication that simultaneously is clear, engaging, and understandable while remaining rigorous and mathematically correct. The panelists have a range of experience with communicating complex statistical concepts to both technical and lay audiences via multiple communication mechanisms including podcasting, Twitter, engaging with journalists in print, and television correspondence on networks such as CNN and BBC. The session will begin with moderated questions posed by the organizer and then open the discussion to audience members."
