    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text"><strong>Objectives</strong><br>The objective was to determine whether patients with low health literacy have higher emergency department (ED) utilization and higher ED recidivism than patients with adequate health literacy.<br><strong>Methods</strong><br>The study was conducted at an urban academic ED with more than 95,000 annual visits that is part of a 13-hospital health system, using electronic records that are captured in a central data repository.

The authors collected patients&rsquo; demographic and clinical data, including items known to affect recidivism.

Descriptive data for demographics and ED returns are reported, stratified by health literacy level. The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square was used to test whether there is an association between health literacy and ED recidivism.
